      <h1>Eli Nichols About Me</h1>
      <p>My name is Eli Nichols. I am a freshman at NKU studying Cybersecurity. I like using computers. I first started using computers when I was 8. I played a game called Garry's Mod on my brothers computer. And ever since I have been working with computers all my life. This made me want to pursue something IT related for a career. I don't know too many programming languages but I have dabbled in Javascript and C and would say I'm fairly proficient with Python. I look forward to learning HTML in this course.</p>
